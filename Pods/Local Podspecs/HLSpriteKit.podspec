                   `HLSpriteKit` is yet another companion library to Apple's `SpriteKit` with the goal of abstracting reusable code.
                   `HLSpriteKit`, in its current form, should probably be used in one of two ways:
                   - Non-committally: As a supply of useful custom `SKNode` subclasses, for example `HLMenuNode` (a hierarchical button menu) or `HLToolbarNode` (a simple button toolbar).
                   - Full committment: As a system for designing an interactive scene, inheriting from `HLScene` and using `UIGestureRecognizers` via `HLGestureTarget`.

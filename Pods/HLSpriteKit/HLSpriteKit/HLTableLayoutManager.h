/**
 Set the positions of all passed nodes according to the layout-affecting parameters.

 For layout to have an effect: `columnCount` must be non-zero, and `columnWidths` and
 `columnAnchorPoints` and `rowHeights` must have at least one element each.

 The order of the passed nodes determines position in the table: rows are filled
 left to right starting with the top row.  A cell is skipped if the corresponding
 element in the array is not a kind of `SKNode` class.  (It is suggested to pass
 `[NSNull null]` to intentionally leave cells empty.)

 This method must always be called explicitly to realize layout changes.  On one
 hand, it's annoying to have to remember to call it; on the other hand, it allows
 the owner efficiently to make multiple changes (e.g. remove a node, insert another
 node, change the `constrainedSize`, etc) and re-layout only exactly once.

 is not large enough to hold all the non-expanding rows or columns, plus the `tableBorder`

@property (nonatomic, assign) CGSize constrainedSize;

/**
 An array of `CGFloat`s specifying the widths of table columns.

 Columns in the table without corresponding widths in the array will be sized according to
 the last column width in the array.

 Special sizes may be specified as followed:

 - A width of `0.0` (that is, a value that has a difference from `0.0` less than
   `HLTableLayoutNodeEpsilon`) means the layout manager should attempt to size the column
   to fit the largest node in the column.  This is a little messy: If a node responds to
   `@selector(size)`, then that width will be used; otherwise if the node is a kind of
   `SKLabelNode`, then `frame.size` will be used; otherwise, the node is considered to
   have zero width.

 - A width less than zero (actually, less than `-HLTableLayoutEpsilon`) will expand the
   column to share the available constrained width of the table.  Furthermore, the extra
   space can be shared unequally: it will be allocated according to the ratio of the
   expanding columns' sizes.  For example, say the constrained width of the table is `100`
   for three columns.  If the `tableBorder` is `1` and the `columnSeparator` is `2`, that
   leaves `95` for the columns.  The first column is specified with a fixed width of `35`,
   leaving `60` for the two remaining columns, which have widths specified as `-1.0` and
   `-2.0`, resulting in actual column widths of `20` and `40`, respectively.

/**
 The anchor points used for cell position calculations during layout.

 This can be used to set vertical and horizontal justification for cells in each column.
 Columns in the table without corresponding anchor points in the array will be anchored
 according to the last anchor point in the array.

 The nodes being laid out may or may not have their own `anchorPoint properties; if
 they do, they will be ignored by this layout manager, though in most cases the
 corresponding column anchor point should be set to the same value.

 An example: Say a table layout manager is laying out rows that contain an
 icon, a line of text, and a few number values.  The icon is a `SKSpriteNode` with
 default `anchorPoint` `(0.5, 0.5)`.  The line of text is an `SKLabelNode` with
 left horizontal alignment and baseline vertical alignment; a good anchor point
 would be `(0.0, 0.25)` to put the label on the left side of the cell and a bit
 up from the bottom (to leave room for the font descender below the baseline).
 The number values are also `SKLabelNode`s with the same baseline alignment, but
 with right alignment, and so they should go at anchor point `(1.0, 0.25)`.  All
 together, a good setting for `columnAnchorPoints` would be:

     @[ [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:CGPointMake(0.5f, 0.5f)],
        [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:CGPointMake(0.0f, 0.25f)],
        [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:CGPointMake(1.0f, 0.25f)] ]

/**
 An `HLLayoutManager` lays out nodes (typically the children nodes of a parent) by
 setting their positions.

 ## Motivation

 Three common patterns for handling child node layout:

 1. The chilren of a node are positioned within it by the owner of the parent node, often
    the `SKScene`, which considers itself the controller of the entire hierarchy.

 2. The children of a custom node subclass are positioned by the node subclass, which
    considers itself the controller of its children.  By convention, the owner of the
    parent node, usually the `SKScene`, interacts only with the node subclass, configuring
    it according to its public interface.

 3. Nodes are positioned by a third party, neither the parent nor the owner.

 The layout manager takes the third approach, with the following features:

 - Parameters are encapsulated with the layout code in an object.  However, the layout
   manager is a protocol, not a class hierarchy, so that any object can be a layout
   manager.  This, in turn, allows reuse of the layout manager for patterns (1) and (2),
   above: the `SKScene` can instantiate a layout manager to position anything in its node
   hierarchy, or a custom node subclass can be its own layout manager.

 - A layout manager can be attached to any `SKNode` through `[SKNode+HLLayoutManager
   hlSetLayoutManager]` (which merely sets the layout manager in the node's `userData`,
   and returns it on demand).  Since layout managers support copying and coding, they will
   remain attached to the node even through duplication and archiving.

 Notes for adopters:

 - Decide whether layout is only performed on-demand (when the owner calls `layout`) or
   whether it happens automatically on the modification of the layout manager's
   properties; document for the owner.  The advantage of the former is that multiple
   property changes can be made efficiently; the advantage of the latter is that the owner
   does not have to make explicit calls.

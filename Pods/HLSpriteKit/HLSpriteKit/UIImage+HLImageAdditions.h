/**
 Convenience method for creating a CoreGraphics context, redrawing multiple shadowed
 copies of the image at radial offsets from the image's center, and returning a new `UIImage`
 with the result.

 The effect is something like an outline or glow (depending on how blurred the shadows
 are).  Uses `CGContextSetShadowWithColor`.

 @param offsetDistance The distance of the offset of the shadows (extending radially from
                       the center of the image).

 @param shadowCount The number of shadows drawn.  The first copy is offset in the
                    direction of zero radians in polar coordinates; the other copies are
                    offset at regular subdivisions of the unit circle.  For instance, if
                    the value of the parameter is `4`, the shadows will be drawn directly
                    left, right, up, and down.

 @param blur The blur for the shadows.

 @param color The color for the shadows.

 @param cutout Whether or not the original image is cut out of the resulting image before
               it is returned.

 @warning Performance not measured.  Assume this is slow, especially with increasing
          `shadowCount`.

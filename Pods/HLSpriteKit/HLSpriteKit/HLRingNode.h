/**
 `HLRingNode` extends (through composition) an `HLItemsNode` with the following features:

 - Items are arranged in a ring centered around the ring node's position.

 - Items are transparent, and are displayed over a background image and beneath a frame
   image.  This can give the illusion of cropping as long as the frame is big enough to
   cover the item content nodes.

 - Because the items themselves are transparent, item content should use
   `HLItemContentNode` in order to indicate various item states (like enabled and
   highlight), if desired.

 - Basic gesture handling support is provided.

 ## Common Gesture Handling Configurations

 - Set this node as its own gesture target (using `[SKNode+HLGestureTarget
   hlSetGestureTarget]`) to get simple delegation and/or a callback for taps.  See
   `HLRingNodeDelegate` for delegation and the `itemTappedBlock` property for setting a
   callback block.

 - Set a custom gesture target to recognize and respond to other gestures.  (Convert touch
   locations to this node's coordinate system and call `itemAtPoint` as desired.)

 - Leave the gesture target unset for no gesture handling.

 The hierarchical menu navigated by the menu node (readonly).

 For the sake of simplicity, menu node does not worry about updating its display when
 the caller makes changes to the individual menu items.  Instead, it will only refresh
 the display after a call to `setMenu:animation:` (or from manual or programmatic
 navigation of the menu).  The readonly attribute helps to suggest this pattern.  More
 stringent would be to copy the menu into the menu node, but that is deemed unnecessary.

 @bug It is considered convenient for the menu node to keep a strong reference to its
      menu, assuming that the caller typically wants a single fairly-static menu
      hierarchy.  An alternate design, perhaps where only "current" menu is tracked,
      should be considered if useful.

 A note on layout and geometry: The `HLMenuNode` lays out the buttons of its menu by setting
 the positions of its buttons, starting at `(0,0)` and incrementing subsequent `y` position
 by `itemSpacing`.  The menu doesn't consider itself to have any other extent: it's just a
 collection of buttons.  As such, it doesn't have geometric properties like `size`
 or `anchorPoint`.  Instead, the caller may call `calculateAccumulatedFrame` on the menu node
 to get bounds, or may use the `displayedMenu` property to infer information about the
 buttons currently displayed.

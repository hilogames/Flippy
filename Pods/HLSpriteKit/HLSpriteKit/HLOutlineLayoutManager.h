/**
 Set the positions of all passed nodes according to the layout-affecting parameters.

 For layout to have an effect: `nodeLevels` must be set for all nodes to be positioned;
 and `levelIndents`, `levelNodeHeights`, and `levelAnchorPointYs` must have at least one
 element each.

 An outline positions its nodes in a vertical list.  Each node is assigned an outline
 level which determines how far it is indented in the horizontal direction.  Other
 geometry options, like a fixed height for each "line" (node), can be specified for each
 outline level.

 As a vertical list, the outline does not know about its own width, or the widths of its
 nodes.  Therefore it does not know anything about X anchor points, either.  Node X
 positions are set starting at `outlineOffset.x` and indented at each outline level by the
 corresponding value in `levelIndents`.

 Some configurations of an outline layout manager only make sense for a fixed number of
 nodes (see, for example, `setNodeLevels:`).  In that case, only as many nodes will be
 laid out as the configuration can support.

 This method must always be called explicitly to realize layout changes.  On one hand,
 it's annoying to have to remember to call it; on the other hand, it allows the owner
 efficiently to make multiple changes and re-layout only exactly once.

 Indents are relative to the indent of the previous level, and so they have a cumulative
 effect on a node.  For instance, if the level indents are:

     outlineLayoutManager.levelIndents = @[ @0.0f, @20.0f, @10.0f ];

 ...then a node at level 3 will have its X position indented from `outlineOffset.x` by
 `40`, which is the sum of the indents of levels 0 through 3 (respectively, `0`, `20`,
 `10`, and `10`).

/**
 An array of `CGFloat` specifying the basic node height used at each level of the outline
 (starting from level zero).

 During layout, each node at a certain outline level will be positioned using the
 corresponding value from the array.  Any level which does not have a corresponding node
 height will use the last value in the array.

 A special height may be specified as follows:

 - A height of `0.0` (that is, a value that has a difference from `0.0` less than
   `HLOutlineLayoutNodeEpsilon`) means the layout manager should attempt to position the
   node according to its natural height.  The height of a node is determined by
   `HLLayoutManagerGetNodeHeight()`; see that function for details.

 There are three heights to consider at each level when configuring vertical spacing in an
 outline.  The node height is the space reserved for a single node at the level.  The
 "before-separator" height (see `levelSeparatorBeforeHeights`) is the space reserved
 before the node at that level, but only if it is not the first node in the outline.  The
 "after-separator" height (see `levelSeparatorAfterHeights`) is the space reserved after
 the node at that level, but only if it is not the last node in the outline.  Visually:

    Example Node I (at Level 0)          ]-- "node height" at level 0
                                         ]-- "after separator" at level 0
      Example Node A (at Level 1)        ]-- the sum of all three heights at level 1
      Example Node B (at Level 1)
      Example Node C (at Level 1)
                                         ]-- "before separator" at level 0
    Example Node II (at Level 0)
                                         ]-- "after separator" at level 0
                                         ]-- "before separator" at level 0
    Example Node III (at Level 0)

 During layout, each node at a certain outline level will be positioned using the
 corresponding value from the array.  Any level which does not have a corresponding anchor
 point Y-value will use the last value in the array.

 The nodes being laid out may or may not have their own `anchorPoint` properties; if they
 do, they will be ignored by this layout manager.  (In most cases the nodes at a certain
 level should have the same anchor point Y-value as their level.)

 An example: It is common to outline text, where each node being laid out is an
 `SKLabelNode` horizontally aligned to the left and vertically aligned at the baseline.
 In such a case, it is good to use the font height (or some other related value) as the
 node height for the level, and the proportion of font descender to total font height as
 the Y anchor point for the level.  Perhaps something like this:

     outlineLayoutManager.levelNodeHeights = @[ @16.0f, @12.0f ];
     outlineLayoutManager.levelAnchorPointYs = @[ @0.25f ];

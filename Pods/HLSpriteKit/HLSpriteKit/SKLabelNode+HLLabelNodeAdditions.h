/**
 A vertical alignment mode which can measure a label not only by its current size (based
 on its current text) but alternately by its inherent font metrics.

 In particular, these alignments are helpful when aligning a label node to a background
 which must appear to frame the text in the label; and even more particularly, when the
 text might change (or be visually compared to other such labels-plus-background).  For
 example, the caller might want to leave space in the background for the font descender
 even if the current label contains no descenders.

@interface SKLabelNode (HLLabelNodeAdditions)

/// @name Calculating Vertical Alignment

/**
 Gets alignment parameters for this `SKLabelNode` to be used when aligning vertically by
 `HLLabelNodeVerticalAlignmentMode`.

 See `HLLabelNodeVerticalAlignmentMode` for details.

 ### Example

 Say you have two label nodes.  The first has no descenders: its text is "bdfhklt".  The
 second has no ascenders: "gpqy".  You wisely choose a vertical alignment of
 `SKLabelVerticalAlignmentModeBaseline`.

 Now the baseline of the label nodes can be set, and they will line up.  You want the
 labels to appear centered within a red background message bar.  Where should you position
 the baseline?  You try putting it in the (vertical) center of the bar.  It seems way too
 high, because for your font the ascenders are much taller than the descenders.  So you
 lower it.  But...by how much?

 This method can help.  Choose your alignment mode from
 `HLLableNodeVerticalAlignmentMode`, then set the position of your label according to the
 (vertical) center of where you want it.  Then add the returned `yOffset` to the
 y-position, and use the returned `skVerticalAlignmentMode` as the label's
 `verticalAlignmentMode`.

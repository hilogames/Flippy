/**
 `HLGridNode` is a component that lays out its content nodes in a grid of similarly-sized
 squares.  It includes various visual format options (like background color and square
 color) as well as geometry options (like pads and spacers).  The grid node tracks certain
 states for the squares (like highlight, enabled, and selection), and also provides some
 simple animations for state changes.

 ## Common Gesture Handling Configurations

 - Set this node as its own gesture target (using `[SKNode+HLGestureTarget
   hlSetGestureTarget]`) to get simple delegation and/or a callbacks for taps.  See
   `HLGridNodeDelegate` for delegation and the `squareTappedBlock` property for setting a
   callback block.

 - Set a custom gesture target to recognize and respond to other gestures.  (Convert touch
   locations to this node's coordinate system and call `squareAtLocation` as desired.)

 - Leave the gesture target unset for no gesture handling.

/// @name Creating a Grid Node

/**
 Initialize a new grid node with values for all layout-affecting parameters.

 note: Currently the layout-affecting parameters are not properties, and so can't be set
 individually, which helps avoid the problem where layout is redone multiple times as
 each parameter is adjusted individually.

 @param gridWidth The maximum number of squares to layout in a row.

 @param squareCount The total number of squares to create in the grid.

 @param anchorPoint The anchorPoint used to layout the grid around the `HLGridNode`'s
                    position.

 @param layoutMode The layout mode for the grid (pertaining chiefly to handling the layout
                   of squares that don't fit exactly into rows); see
                   `HLGridNodeLayoutMode`.

 @param squareSize The normal size of a square when it fits in a row; see
                   `HLGridNodeLayoutMode` for exceptions.

 @param backgroundBorderSize The distance, in pixels, between the edge of the background
                             and the nearest squares.

 @param squareSeparatorSize The distance, in pixels, between squares; the background
                            color shows through in this area.

 @return A configured `HLGridNode`.

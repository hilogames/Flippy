/**
 `HLItemsNode` maintains a collection of `HLItemNode` children nodes, and provides an
 interface for common interactions.

 It is intended to be a base class (through composition) for classes which contain a
 group of buttons or icons or tools for a more-specific purpose; it provides common
 functionality.  "Inheritance by composition" is recommended: Some of the interface is
 best protected from the end-user, and certain things like `zPosition` management are much
 easier when this class is its own component of an owner.

 Initializes an items node with its items.

 After initialization, it is typical for the items to be configured with content (see
 `setContent:`) and laid out by the derived class.

 @param itemCount The number of items that will be maintained by the items node.

 @param itemPrototypeNode An `HLItemNode` which will be copied to create each item node.

 Convenience method for calling `[HLItemNode setContent:]` on the item nodes, in order,
 with a content node from the passed array.

 The items node was created with a fixed number of items, and only that many content nodes
 may be set; any extras passed in the array will be ignored.  An item may be left without
 content by passing `[NSNull null]` in the appropriate position in the array.

 See `HLItemNode` for notes on how content is managed by the container item node, and for
 notes on `HLItemNode` configuration (for example, what `anchorPoint` to expect).

 applications.  Compare `itemClosestToPoint` for an alternative.

                        will be enforced.

 @param closestDistance If not `nil`, and if the method returns a closest node, will be
                        set with the distance of the closest node.

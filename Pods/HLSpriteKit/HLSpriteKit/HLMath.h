/**
 Find the bounds (size-only) of a rectangle (size-only) after it has first been rotated.

 @bug I'm going to document the motivating example in case it helps point to an alternate
      or better solution.  I've got an `SKNode` descendant which I'm going to display in a
      box.  The node's size property does not yet account for the node's desired rotation,
      but I can use this function to calculate it myself so I know how big to make the
      display box.  (The node also has a `frame.size`, which already accounts for rotation
      and scaling, but unfortunately the calculated frame only contains visible areas of
      the node, which is not the same as its desired display size.)

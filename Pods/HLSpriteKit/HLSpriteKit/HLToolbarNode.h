/**
 `HLToolbarNode` lays out its content ("tools") in a horizontal row of squares, like a
 toolbar.  It provides various visual formatting options, and also various geometry
 options (for example, fitting the tools to a certain toolbar size).  It maintains some
 state information about tools (like enabled and highlight), and provides some simple
 animation for paging or setting tools in the toolbar.

 ## Common Gesture Handling Configurations

 - Set this node as its own gesture target (using `[SKNode+HLGestureTarget
   hlSetGestureTarget]`) to get a simple callback for taps via the `toolTappedBlock`
   property.
 
 - Set a custom gesture target to recognize and respond to other gestures.  (Convert touch
   locations to this node's coordinate system and call `toolAtLocation` as desired.)
 
 - Leave the gesture target unset for no gesture handling.

/// @name Getting and Setting Tools

/**
 Sets tool nodes in the toolbar and effects layout according to all object properties.

 The square node that holds each tool has `anchorPoint` `(0.5, 0.5)`.

 Each tool node is expected to have a size selector which reports its desired size.  (The
 size is expected to behave like `[SKSpriteNode size]` property, where the `SKNode`
 `xScale` and `yScale` are already reflected in the reported size, but the `SKNode`
 `zRotation` is not.)  Depending on other object properties, either the tools will be
 scaled to fit the toolbar or vice versa.  In particular:

 - If `automaticWidth` and `automaticHeight` are both `YES`, the toolbar will set its
   height to the maximum tool node height (plus relevant pads and borders) and its width
   to the sum of the tool node widths (plus relevant pads and borders).

 - If only `automaticWidth` is `YES`, and toolbar height is fixed, the toolbar will scale
   the tool nodes so that the tallest tool node will fit the toolbar height (plus relevant
   pads and borders), and the others will be scaled proportionally.

 - If only `automaticHeight` is `YES`, and toolbar width is fixed, the toolbar will scale
   the tool nodes proportionally to each other so that the sum of tool node widths will
   fit the toolbar width (plus relevant pads and borders).

 - Otherwise, with both toolbar width and height fixed, the toolbar will scale the tools
   proportionally so they fit into both the fixed width and fixed height.

 @param tools The array of `SKNode`s to be set as tools.

 @param toolTags An array of same length as tools containing strings to be used as
                 identifiers for the tools.  These tags (rather than, for example, indexes
                 in the array) are used in all other interfaces in this object interacting
                 with particular tools.

 @param animation Animation, if any.  See `HLToolbarNodeAnimation`.

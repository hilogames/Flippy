 * must (by its calculated progress and tangent) have the same tangent and direction.
 * For example: Imagine two curved segment pieces stacked on top of each other in the
 * shape of a letter C.  The train goes halfway through the curve from the top and
 * wants to connect to the lower segment.  The passed rotation is passed in either
 * PI/2 or -PI/2, depending on implementation; the passed progress is either 0 or
 * or 1, depending on implementation.  The lower segment will match.  A counter
 * example: Picture the same situation but with curved segments stacked in the shape

 * But in that case the switch has a direction: Traveling, say, "with" the switch,
 * the switch determines your path; traveling "against" the switch, all paths end up
 * end up in the same place regardless of the switch setting.
 *

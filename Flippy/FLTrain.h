/**
 * A train running on a track grid.
 *
 * noob: I could either subclass SKSpriteNode, and then have a documented relationship with
 * the owner, or else subclass NSObject and have an explicit interface with the owner.
 * Though the latter seems like better design, for now I'm going with the former; it seems
 * to me that it's a common pattern, and even comes with a basic convention already in place
 * (e.g. the owner doesn't mess with this node's children).  That said, for my other subclassed
 * nodes, the owner can choose scale and position and rotation and such; this one might be
 * a little more restrictive, since I'm including all that logic inside here.  So, all
 * inherited properties of this class are currently considered read-only for the owner except:
 *
 *    . parent
 *    . scale
 *    . zPosition

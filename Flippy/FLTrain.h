/**
 * A train running on a track grid.
 *
 * noob: I could either subclass SKSpriteNode, and then have a documented relationship with
 * the owner, or else subclass NSObject/SKNode and have an explicit interface with the owner.
 * Though the latter seems like better design, for now I'm going with the former; it seems
 * to me that it's a common pattern, and even comes with a basic convention already in place
 * (e.g. the owner doesn't mess with this node's children).  That said, for my other subclassed
 * nodes, the owner can choose scale and position and rotation and such; this one might be
 * a little more restrictive, since I'm including all that logic inside here.  So, all
 * inherited properties of this class are currently considered read-only for the owner except:
 *
 *    . parent
 *    . scale
 *    . zPosition

 * @param The point for which the search is performed, in world coordinates.
 *
 * @param The "radius" of segments (adjacent to the segment containing the passed point) searched.
 *        More precisely: A square of segments are checked; the square is centered on the segment
 *        that contains the passed point; the square's edge length is (2 * gridSearchDistance) + 1.
 *
 * @param The precision used for searching for points along the track paths of searched segments.
 *        The measurement unit is "progress", since that's the unit used to measure segment paths.
 *        For visual purposes, the caller might choose to pass "progress per pixel": Under normal
 *        circumstances that will be a straight track segment progress length (1.0) divided by the
 *        pixels per (basic) segment edge (_trackGrid->segmentSize()) scaled by current worldScale.

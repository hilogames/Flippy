/**
 * Represents square segments that occupy a two-dimensional world.
 * The track grid deals in integer grid coordinates, and, given a
 * segment edge size, floating point world coordinates.  (The grid and
 * world share the same origin.)
 *
 * note: Consider a generic implementation that in place of "track"
 * and "segment" and "world" uses terms like "field" or "square" or
 * "cell".
 *
 * Alternate Implementation
 *
 * The current implementation models a track composed of square
 * pieces.  In particular, it's good for an interface where you place
 * square track pieces into the grid, and then rotate them around as
 * necessary so that their corners hook together.
 *
 * An alternate model would support the actual mechanics and
 * computations a little better -- though it might lead to a different
 * interface paradigm, also, and so might involve a pretty serious
 * rewrite.  Like this:
 *
 *  . The model tracks vertices/intersections in a quadtree square
 *    grid.  (Or on a hex field, or whatever.)
 *
 *  . Each vertex contains a few edges which link the vertex to any of
 *    the eight surrounding vertices.  (Or to any arbitrary vertex on
 *    the grid, though I have a feeling it will always be better to do
 *    it in little pieces.)  The edge is linked from the other vertex,
 *    too.
 *
 *  . The edge knows its end point vertices (either pointers back to
 *    the two vertices, or grid coordinates, or perhaps even a single
 *    vertex plus a direction).  For each end point it also knows the
 *    tangent -- probably just in four or eight or twelve discrete
 *    compass points, so probably stored as an integer direction
 *    (e.g. rotationQuarters).
 *
 *  . When adding a new edge to a vertex, then, it would be pretty
 *    easy to detect if any other existing edges had the same tangent,
 *    which would mean they (as a group) would need a switch; and it
 *    would be easy to detect if any other existing edges had an
 *    opposite tangent, which would mean they connect.
 *
 *  . Furthermore, it would be easy to lookup/generate the
 *    corresponding cubic Bezier curve to use as a continuous path for
 *    the edge, since the first and fourth control points would be the
 *    vertices, and the middle control points could be easily
 *    generated to produce the correct tangents.  If the number of
 *    connectable vertices and discrete tangents were limited, then
 *    these paths would be fairly easily enumerable: straight, curve,
 *    S-curve, question mark curve, etc.
 *
 *  . For the graphics, each path would have a graphic, and then a
 *    switch could be positioned dynamically where needed, and certain
 *    path combinations would be replaced by a compound graphic -- or
 *    maybe the intersection would be drawn over top of the two paths
 *    in the right location and rotation, either a right angle
 *    intersection, 45 degree intersection, or whatever.
 *
 *  . In the interface, track would be added by drawing connections
 *    between vertices.  Connections in the middle of the drawing
 *    would have their tangents determined by the outer connections.
 *    Endpoints of the drawn line would not necessarily know how to
 *    shape themselves, but could be patched up by selection edits.
 *    Track edges/curves/unions (i.e. pieces of track) could be
 *    selected and dragged around, possibly by using SpriteKits hit
 *    test abilities (since the determination of edge selection has
 *    more to do with its visible sprite than its grid position).
 *
 * Anyway, I think I'm going to pass on this for now, even though it
 * would be pretty clearly awesome.

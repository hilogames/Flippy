/**
 Stores textures and (sometimes) corresponding images by key for easy reuse.

 @bug This texture store supports both `UIImages` and `SKTextures`, so that the graphics
      can be used either as a texture (for `SpriteKit` purposes) or as a `UIImage` (for
      `CoreGraphics` purposes).  Maybe this is stupid.

Flippy the Train is a train simulation that can be used to model logic
circuits.

. Make toolbar to create track pieces; show grid snap without outline;
  snap to grid when deselected.  (See below.)

. Track composition tools: Simple grid, rather than hierarchy of
  subtracks, I guess, since that's how I did it originally.

    TODO:  How does selection/deselection work?

    . Add segments or subtracks:

      . Drag a segment or subtrack from a toolbar, after which it is
        selected and can be rotated/mirrored/deleted/moved.  Only
        written into track once unselected, but can be manipulated
        before it is written in.

      . Draw a line with your finger, segments created automatically.
        Better: A special "auto connect" path subtrack which
        calculates a path between two specified segments and maintains
        the connection following moves and rotations of those
        segments.  (This might be out of the scope of the project.)

    . A rotate/mirror/delete/move popup toolbar shows (at bottom of
      screen?  at bottom of selection?  in a circle around the
      selection?  probably at bottom of screen, for better support of
      non-contiguous selection?) whenever something is selected, but
      gestures can be used instead of tapping on buttons.

    . Undo stack.

    . Selection should be a mode?  When you add something it is
      selected.  If you , but you can't change the selection without entering
      selection mode.  A separate selection tool that allows selection
      of segments by coloring them (and/or fast tapping, if it's too
      hard to distinguish coloring from scroll/zoom actions).

      . Rotate

      . Delete

  include adding entire other tracks, though.  Also: undo stack.
  Also: Multiple selection (both rectangle and shift-click type) which
  can then rotate all Decide whether subtracks can be rotated and
  movedThis time around, make the track model a hierarchy of
  subtracks, the smallest of which can be 1x1, so that

. Draw a train.  (Orient to the right!)

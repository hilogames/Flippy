Flippy the Train is a train simulation that can be used to model logic
circuits.



Current

  . Multiple selection: long press.  Panning afterwards extends
    selection.  Rewrite track move code to be able to move all
    selected segments.

  . Import subtracks: Tap tool in creation toolbar to choose a
    subtrack (through a couple popups).  Drag it to import it.  Would
    be nice to group subtracks into folders: prefab gates, prefab
    circuits (half adder, full adder, two-bit adder), and
    user-exported custom circuits.

  . Export subtrack: A button next to the import button, which uses
    current selection.  (Not part of context-sensitive popup, I don't
    think.)

  . Start splash and start menu, with save/load/new options.  Button
    in simulation toolbar to return to start menu.

  . Special input and output segments which have switches but no
    track (and perhaps have a readout of binary value).

Medium Priority

  . Pan world when track move goes to edge of scene.

  . Consider recentering world as needed when construction tool is
    released, so that track edit popup menu can fit fully onscreen.
    (Get the track edit menu to report its width, I guess, and then
    do the centering in the handleGesture method.)

  . Rotation gesture recognizer for rotation; flick for deletion;
    pinch or something for mirror.

Low Priority

  . If multiple trains, then train edit menu for play/pause controls
    (and an explicit way to turn train around, perhaps).

  . Art for retina devices.  Also note the terrain tiling graphics
    context needs scaling options set for retina to successfully tile
    things (I think).

  . Draw a line with your finger, segments created automatically.
    Better: A special "auto connect" path subtrack which
    calculates a path between two specified segments and maintains
    the connection following moves and rotations of those
    segments.

  . Undo stack.

  . Train acceleration.

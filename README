Flippy the Train is a train simulation that can be used to model logic
circuits.



Current

Other

  . Persist track.

  . Save/load tracks/subtracks.

Train

  . Stop/pause, follow path.

  . Train drag.

  . Train edit menu and gesture for turning the train around (and, if
    multiple trains, for individual play/pause controls).

Devices

  . Art for retina devices.  Also note the terrain tiling graphics
    context needs scaling options set for retina to successfully tile
    things (I think).

Track Editing and Composition

  . Pan world when track move goes to edge of scene.

  . Consider recentering world as needed when construction tool is
    released, so that track edit popup menu can fit fully onscreen.
    (Get the track edit menu to report its width, I guess, and then
    do the centering in the handleGesture method.)

  . Add mirror transformation to track edit menu, or else create a
    separate mirrored segment for "join".

  . Rotation gesture recognizer for rotation; flick for deletion;
    pinch or something for mirror.

  . Draw a line with your finger, segments created automatically.
    Better: A special "auto connect" path subtrack which
    calculates a path between two specified segments and maintains
    the connection following moves and rotations of those
    segments.  (This might be out of the scope of the project.)

  . Undo stack.

  . Multiple selection and editing.  (Paint a selection; draw a
    rectangle for selection; shift-click-type selection; etc.)

Flippy the Train is a train simulation that can be used to model logic
circuits.


Current

  . TODO: Okay, yes, need to get goals stuff out of track scene.  It's
    like 1000 lines.

  . Another record: fastest solution time (keep timer whenever in
    foreground, I guess)

  . TODO: Make HLGestureTarget an HLGestureManager, and do it the same
    way as HLLayoutManager.

  . Goals Screen
    . Track piece count for solved levels; have records.  Would be
      cool if there were two records: the fewest piece award, but
      also the rube goldberg award for more-than-X switched joins, and
      "the long ride" for most traveled pieces, etc.  Fewest joins.
    . At same time as above: victory message should say what is unlocked
      as well as what achievments were earned.  Little checklist with
      sparkler bursts: kachung! kachung! kachung!
        . goal accomplished: ka-chick?
        . achievement: brr-bring
      Probably use HLScrollNode to center the action on small screens.
      Consider sparkling each output as it's checked; total duration
      constant (2 seconds, maybe) so it doesn't take forever with lots
      of outputs.  Scroll along with the checks if necessary.  Ooo: maybe
      zoom way in on them.  Then
      "Level complete!", achievements, and the button similarly appear,
      with effects, and centered if necessary.  Then:
    . Also maybe prompt user to save (and/or autosave) on victory rather
      than going straight to next level.
    . Consider splitting goals screen into two tabs on a tabbed
      component: goals information on one tab, and results+victory on
      another.  (Make new HLTabbedNode or something.)

  . Interface help screen (explain holding down for multi-select,
    double-two-finger-click switches, hold down switch to delete it,
    center button to find and follow train, hold center button to
    reset zoom, rotate gesture, double-tap to select connected).

  . "About" screen with name.  Choose production company.  Reserve
    website?  Include feedback email address?  Credits: grass texture
    (goodtextures.com); DSMultilineButton.

  . Split off HLSpriteKit as a CocoaPod; re-create project.  Upload to
    github.  Put open source link into the About screen.

  . Replace DSMultilineLabelNode with SuperSpriteKit / SSKMultiLineLabelNode.h?
  . Use SSKTileableNode in SuperSpriteKit?

  . Low memory warning.  (Test in debugger.)

  . Infinite grid and real quadtree.

    - QuadTree and SKNode hierarchy should be coordinated, and load/unload
      cells/areas/tiles at the same time.

    - Maybe best to try and find implementations of this, and adapt
      one for our use.

    - Perhaps at the same time generate terrain in a way that is less
      uniform than just a tiled image.  At one point I had an idea to
      do random patches of squares in earth tones, procedurally
      generated like Minecraft.

  . Localize the saved circuit/gate names, perhaps in a plist like the
    challenge level information.

  . Maybe at the same time as doing icons and splash screens: Check
    SKScene dimensions for each device; is anything being scaled that
    shouldn't be?  c.f. nativeScale documentation on UIScreen.

  . Either implement a simple undo stack to undo deletions, or else
    make the delete button be long-press.

Lower Priority

  . Consider showing the track edit menu on the side or top or bottom
    of the screen (in the HUD) rather than on top of the selection (in
    the world).  Not only would it make the code easier, but it would
    make it easier to e.g. repeatedly-rotate a selection.  Then maybe
    also some selection-sensitive buttons could join that menu: export
    and duplicate, in particular.

  . For challenge games, show the level title in the save game slots
    when loading and saving.  (Need to encode the level number
    separately from the track scene, I think, so that the track scene
    doesn't have to be unencoded just to get some meta information.  I
    think it is possible to encode it at the top level of the archive,
    and then open the archive and only decode the meta-information
    keys, without decoding the track scene.  Although: Does prepping
    an NSKeyedUnarchiver with binary XML data, and then scanning
    through it, require too much time even without encoding the track
    scene within?)

  . Track destruction of readout and platform should not show the
    same particle emitters as normal segments.

  . Prettier links.  Maybe quadratic Bezier curves for link nodes.
    Maybe different coloring.

  . Long press on saved games deletes them.

  . For import thumbnails: Trace out CG lines for track segment paths
    rather than shrinking down images.  The result might be better.
    (And wouldn't need UIImages anymore in HLTextureStore.)

  . For multisegment rotation: In case of conflict, search for nearby
    pivot that would work without conflicts.  Shouldn't be hard to
    check a few anyway.

  . Prettier Bezier curves for links . . . well, if it does indeed
    look better.  Control points chosen so that the links always curve
    a bit: Perhaps usually normal to the switch dirction, in the
    direction of the other endpoint, but then if the other endpoint
    has the same X or Y coordinate, then bend it 45 degrees or
    something.

  . Inertia for scrolling pan motion.

  . Consider doing tutorial stuff for the Half Adder level: Show the
    user how to handle gates/circuits/exports.

  . If multiple trains, then train edit menu for play/pause controls
    (and an explicit way to turn train around, perhaps).

  . Draw a line with your finger, segments created automatically.
    Better: A special "auto connect" path subtrack which
    calculates a path between two specified segments and maintains
    the connection following moves and rotations of those
    segments.

  . Undo stack.

  . Train acceleration.

  . "Advanced" interface mode where most messages and tutorial are
    suppressed.

Flippy the Train is a train simulation that can be used to model logic
circuits.



Current

  . Sound effects for toolbar operations.

  . Start splash and start menu.  Button in simulation toolbar to
    return to start menu.  Main: "Challenge" and "Sandbox".  Then:
    A list of loads, or a "New" button.

  . Menus: Get "back" button working.  Then: Put menu scene
    functionality into a node, rather than a scene, so that it can
    overlay a scene.  Include new functionality for disabling the
    background (e.g. auto-pause of scene, and no gesture recognition).
    Then make two menus: a main menu and an in-game menu.  In-game
    menu will overlay the track scene.  Then go back and redo how the
    view controller archives things, since it will now be different.

  . Make a copy/duplicate of current selection.  Insert the same way
    as an import, so factor out that code.

  . Special input and output segments which have switches but no track
    (and perhaps have a readout of binary value).  (Consider how this
    would work in "puzzle" mode for the game.)

  . Pan world when track move (or multi-selection, or any pan gesture)
    goes to edge of scene.

  . Consider recentering world as needed when construction tool is
    released, so that track edit popup menu can fit fully onscreen.
    (Get the track edit menu to report its width, I guess, and then
    do the centering in the handleGesture method.)

If It Ships

  . Low memory warning.

Lower Priority

  . Long press on saved games deletes them.

  . For import thumbnails: Trace out CG lines for track segment paths
    rather than shrinking down images.  The result might be better.
    (And wouldn't need UIImages anymore in HLTextureStore.)

  . Sound effects for train start, train stop, switch switching,
    message appear, menu navigation, ...

  . For multisegment rotation: In case of conflict, search for nearby
    pivot that would work without conflicts.  Shouldn't be hard to
    check a few anyway.

  . Prettier Bezier curves for links . . . well, if it does indeed
    look better.  Control points chosen so that the links always curve
    a bit: Perhaps usually normal to the switch dirction, in the
    direction of the other endpoint, but then if the other endpoint
    has the same X or Y coordinate, then bend it 45 degrees or
    something.

  . Mirror tool especially for mirroring a large selection.  (And
    maybe then remove mirror images from segment construction
    toolbar, since it would work for single segments, too.)

  . A tool/gesture for selecting everything connected to the current
    segment.

  . Intertia for scrolling pan motion.

  . Better interface fitting on iPhone, especially portrait: Expanding
    toolbars?

  . Rotation gesture recognizer for rotation; flick for deletion;
    pinch or something for mirror.

  . If multiple trains, then train edit menu for play/pause controls
    (and an explicit way to turn train around, perhaps).

  . Draw a line with your finger, segments created automatically.
    Better: A special "auto connect" path subtrack which
    calculates a path between two specified segments and maintains
    the connection following moves and rotations of those
    segments.

  . Undo stack.

  . Train acceleration.

Flippy the Train is a train simulation that can be used to model logic
circuits.



Current

  . Prettier highlight of join segment when linking.  Better detection
    of "closest segment" when tapping.

  . Track piece count for solved levels; have achievements.  Would be
    cool if there were two achievements: the fewest piece award, but
    also the rube goldberg award for more-than-X switched joins, and
    "the long ride" for most traveled pieces, etc.
  . At same time as above: victory message should say what is unlocked
    as well as what achievments were earned.  Little checklist with
    sparkler bursts: kachung! kachung! kachung!
      . goal accomplished: ka-chick?
      . achievement: brr-bring

  . Also maybe prompt user to save (and/or autosave) on victory rather
    than going straight to next level.

  . Pan world when track move (or multi-selection, or any pan gesture)
    goes to edge of scene.

  . Consider recentering world as needed when construction tool is
    released, so that track edit popup menu can fit fully onscreen.
    (Get the track edit menu to report its width, I guess, and then
    do the centering in the handleGesture method.)

  . Make a copy/duplicate of current selection.  Insert the same way
    as an import, so factor out that code.

  . Goals screen (esp with results) doesn't fit, especially when
    showing results and with victory button and in landscape on 3.5
    inch iPhone.  Maybe some screen-specific code would be
    appropriate; font size or side-by-side display or a button for
    details or something.  Maybe toggle goals-long display with
    results display?  Or even both goals-short+goals-long.

  . Interface help screen (explain holding down for multi-select,
    double-click switches, hold down switch to delete it, center
    button to find and follow train, hold center button to reset
    zoom).

If It Ships

  . Low memory warning.  (Test in debugger.)

  . Infinite grid, and/or real quadtree.

  . Localize the saved circuit/gate names, perhaps in a plist like the
    challenge level information.

Lower Priority

  . For challenge games, show the level title in the save game slots
    when loading and saving.  (Need to encode the level number
    separately from the track scene, I think, so that the track scene
    doesn't have to be unencoded just to get some meta information.  I
    think it is possible to encode it at the top level of the archive,
    and then open the archive and only decode the meta-information
    keys, without decoding the track scene.  Although: Does prepping
    an NSKeyedUnarchiver with binary XML data, and then scanning
    through it, require too much time even without encoding the track
    scene within?)

  . Track destruction of readout and platform should not show the
    same particle emitters as normal segments.

  . Prettier links.  Maybe quadratic Bezier curves for link nodes.
    Maybe different coloring.

  . Long press on saved games deletes them.

  . For import thumbnails: Trace out CG lines for track segment paths
    rather than shrinking down images.  The result might be better.
    (And wouldn't need UIImages anymore in HLTextureStore.)

  . For multisegment rotation: In case of conflict, search for nearby
    pivot that would work without conflicts.  Shouldn't be hard to
    check a few anyway.

  . Prettier Bezier curves for links . . . well, if it does indeed
    look better.  Control points chosen so that the links always curve
    a bit: Perhaps usually normal to the switch dirction, in the
    direction of the other endpoint, but then if the other endpoint
    has the same X or Y coordinate, then bend it 45 degrees or
    something.

  . Mirror tool especially for mirroring a large selection.  (And
    maybe then remove mirror images from segment construction
    toolbar, since it would work for single segments, too.)

  . A tool/gesture for selecting everything connected to the current
    segment.

  . Intertia for scrolling pan motion.

  . Better interface fitting on iPhone, especially portrait: Expanding
    toolbars?

  . Rotation gesture recognizer for rotation; flick for deletion;
    pinch or something for mirror.

  . If multiple trains, then train edit menu for play/pause controls
    (and an explicit way to turn train around, perhaps).

  . Draw a line with your finger, segments created automatically.
    Better: A special "auto connect" path subtrack which
    calculates a path between two specified segments and maintains
    the connection following moves and rotations of those
    segments.

  . Undo stack.

  . Train acceleration.

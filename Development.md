## Release Checklist

- genstrings

- analyze code

- build using release scheme


## Current Tasks

- Clear saved games on reset app.

- Maybe at the same time as doing icons and splash screens: Check
  SKScene dimensions for each device; is anything being scaled that
  shouldn't be?  c.f. nativeScale documentation on UIScreen.

- Infinite grid and real quadtree.

    - QuadTree and SKNode hierarchy should be coordinated, and load/unload
      cells/areas/tiles at the same time.

    - Maybe best to try and find implementations of this, and adapt
      one for our use.

    - Perhaps at the same time generate terrain in a way that is less
      uniform than just a tiled image.  At one point I had an idea to
      do random patches of squares in earth tones, procedurally
      generated like Minecraft.

- Either implement a simple undo stack to undo deletions, or else make
  the delete button be long-press.  Simple undo stack: Save deletion to
  a file, like an export.  Keep the last five around on filesystem,
  and create a button like "duplicate" to "undo" them.

- Different output options: Segments that turn solid black or white
  when 1 or 0; segments that move/rotate other segments when 1.

    - challenge level is dark, and you must light the light in
      order to complete?

    - robots: put the circuit on a platform, and different outputs
      activate movement in a different direction.

    - guns: fire a mortar to attack someone else's track.

- Upload Flippy to github.  Can't have HLSpriteKit be a development
  dependency anymore, though . . . or can you?

- Add a forum to hilogames.com, with development and game topics.  If
  so, add a link to the README.md.

- Put app store link in README.md.


## Future Tasks

- Records screen (showing records for all levels).

- Localize the saved circuit/gate names, perhaps in a plist like the
  challenge level information.

- Consider showing the track edit menu on the side or top or bottom of
  the screen (in the HUD) rather than on top of the selection (in the
  world).  Not only would it make the code easier, but it would make
  it easier to e.g. repeatedly-rotate a selection.  Then maybe also
  some selection-sensitive buttons could join that menu: export and
  duplicate, in particular.

- For challenge games, show the level title in the save game slots
  when loading and saving.  (Need to encode the level number
  separately from the track scene, I think, so that the track scene
  doesn't have to be unencoded just to get some meta information.  I
  think it is possible to encode it at the top level of the archive,
  and then open the archive and only decode the meta-information keys,
  without decoding the track scene.  Although: Does prepping an
  NSKeyedUnarchiver with binary XML data, and then scanning through
  it, require too much time even without encoding the track scene
  within?)

- Track destruction of readout and platform should not show the
  same particle emitters as normal segments.

- Prettier links.  Maybe quadratic Bezier curves for link nodes.
  Maybe different coloring.

- For import thumbnails: Trace out CG lines for track segment paths
  rather than shrinking down images.  The result might be better.
  (And wouldn't need UIImages anymore in HLTextureStore.)

- For multisegment rotation: In case of conflict, search for nearby
  pivot that would work without conflicts.  Shouldn't be hard to check
  a few anyway.

- Prettier Bezier curves for links . . . well, if it does indeed look
  better.  Control points chosen so that the links always curve a bit:
  Perhaps usually normal to the switch dirction, in the direction of
  the other endpoint, but then if the other endpoint has the same X or
  Y coordinate, then bend it 45 degrees or something.

- Inertia for scrolling pan motion.

- Consider doing tutorial stuff for the Half Adder level: Show the
  user how to handle gates/circuits/exports.

- If multiple trains, then train edit menu for play/pause controls
  (and an explicit way to turn train around, perhaps).

- Draw a line with your finger, segments created automatically.
  Better: A special "auto connect" path subtrack which calculates a
  path between two specified segments and maintains the connection
  following moves and rotations of those segments.

- Undo stack.

- Train acceleration.

- "Advanced" interface mode where most messages and tutorial are
  suppressed.

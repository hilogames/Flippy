Flippy the Train is a toy train simulation that can model logic
circuits.


## Obtaining the Application

Flippy the Train is available for download in the Apple App Store
using the following link:

  [insert app store link here]


## Obtaining Source Code

The source code for Flippy the Train is available under MIT License in
the form of an Xcode project from GitHub (github.com):

  https://github.com/hilogames/Flippy

The project uses Cocoapods (cocoapods.org) to manage its dependencies.
Currently, all dependencies are committed to the main git repository,
and so don't need to need to be downloaded or installed separately.
If you do want to modify the dependencies, though, use `pod update` as
normal.

Of particular note is the standalone library called `HLSpriteKit`,
which was developed alongside Flippy the Train.  For releases of
Flippy the Train to github, though, it should be listed as a regular
CocoaPods dependency.  The code for `HLSpriteKit` is here:

  https://github.com/hilogames/HLSpriteKit


## Building

Flippy the Train builds in Xcode 6.1 for iPhone and iPad devices using
a deployment target of iOS 7.0 (with iOS 8.1 SDKs).

It might build for other things, too.  But nobody knows.


## Documentation

The file Documentation.md contains a pathetic amount of information.
It's more insulting than useful.

On the bright side, the author has a habit of leaving rambling,
unintelligible comments in the code.

HLSpriteKit, the library of reusable components used heavily in Flippy
the Train, is documented by CocoaDocs (cocoadocs.org) here:

## Development, Features, and Bugs

An informal list of ideas, features, and bugs sits quietly in the
Development.md file included in the project.

Other development information is tracked at the GitHub project:

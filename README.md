# Flippy the Train

Flippy the Train is a toy train simulation that can model logic
circuits.

For iPhone and iPad running iOS7 or higher.

More information is supposedly available on
[hilogames.com/flippy](http://hilogames.com/flippy/), but really it's
the same information in a different form.

## Obtaining the Application

Get Flippy the Train on the Apple App Store using this
[link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flippy-the-train/id957889052?mt=8).

## Obtaining Source Code

The source code for Flippy the Train is available under MIT License.
Visit the project page at
[github.com/hilogames/Flippy](https://github.com/hilogames/Flippy).

The project uses [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage its
dependencies.  Currently, all dependencies are committed to the main
git repository (and so don't need to need to be downloaded or
installed separately).

Of particular note is the standalone library called `HLSpriteKit`,
which was developed alongside Flippy the Train.  The code for
`HLSpriteKit` is also on GitHub at
[github.com/hilogames/HLSpriteKit](https://github.com/hilogames/HLSpriteKit).

## Building

Flippy the Train builds in Xcode 6.1 for iPhone and iPad devices using
a deployment target of iOS 7.0 (with iOS 8.1 SDKs).

It might build for other things, too.  But nobody knows.

## Documentation

The file Documentation.md contains an insultingly-small amount of
information.

`HLSpriteKit`, the library of reusable components used heavily in
Flippy the Train, is documented by [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org) at
[cocoadocs.org/docsets/HLSpriteKit](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/HLSpriteKit).

## Help, Discussion, and Feedback

Bugs and features are tracked on the
[GitHub project page](https://github.com/hilogames/Flippy).

Users can discuss gameplay and user-facing issues on the
[Hilo Games forum](http://hilogames.com/forum/).

An informal list of ideas, features, and bugs sits quietly in the
Development.md file included in the project.  This should fade into
obsolescence over time.
